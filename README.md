# UW weather
- UW grabs the NWS forecast then gives it back to us so we can post it on the map
- Collects WWA
- Weather wasn't one of the most requested ones
- local weather reports are terrible
- NWS is the best forecast you can have
- every hour they run a pavement model
- calibrated pavement temp forecast out 24 hours
- perform more aggressive grant funding
